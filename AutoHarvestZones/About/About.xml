    Tired of manually clearing trees to remove cover for raiders or to keep your wind turbines running at max efficiency? 
    Or maybe you just want to automate the process of harvesting trees for wood? This mod is for you!

    <b>Key Features:</b>
    - <i>Tree Harvesting Zones</i>: Place zones that automatically harvest and clear trees. Each zone can be set to wait until trees are harvestable, fully grown, or to cut any saplings.
    - <i>Auto-Harvest for Plants</i>: Automatically designate plants like berry bushes, healroot, ambrosia, and more for harvest when they are ready. No more forgetting to gather resources like berries or ambrosia during critical survival moments.

    With <b>AutoHarvestZones</b>, managing your resources has never been easier, leaving you with more time to focus on other tasks while ensuring your colony thrives.
